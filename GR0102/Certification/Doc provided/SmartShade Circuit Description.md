## SmartShade Circuit Description 

RYSE SmartShades can automate any shade with a beaded chain or looped string cord. It allows customer to control a shade or blends electrically. 

BLE-0101 is a BLE5.0 module that is dedicated to implement Blue tooth communicating between the SmartShade and cell phones. 

BLE-0101 has a built-in PCB trace antenna. The antenna works in BLE band(2.4002~2.485GHz) 

BLE-0101 controls a few LEDS. The LEDs tells users how to interact with SmartShade. 

BLE-0101 reads a few buttons. The buttons tells SmartShade what to do. 

MSP430FR2311 MCU is a stand by MCU that count how much the cord moves(back-drive) manually by a human force. It reads the two signals that are 90 degrees interval in terms of phase generated by the hall effect sensor built-in the motor. It implements a quadrature encoder to tell the direction and counts. 

MSP430FR2311 interfaces with BLE-0101 by two interrupt lines and SPI bus. 

Power is  9V-13V from the wall adapter or battery pack. 

The regulator regulates 3.3v to the whole system.
