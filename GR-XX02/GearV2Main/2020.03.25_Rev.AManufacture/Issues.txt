Bottom Board:
	1. J1 is reversed in pinout. Keep the routing and reverse the pinout in Sch.
	2. J1 is not reversed, add a corner on outline of J1
	3. J2 is easy to break.
	4. bottom solder mask issue
	5. Add 12k Ohm on M+ and M-
	6. R2-6 R43,R44might be 10k
	7. remove r46
	8. remove c22, c23, c32, c41, c22 is changed to 12k
	6. r60 change to 10k
	7. add 3SMAJ5927B-TP between M- and GND
	

Main Board:
	1. X3 is updated to FC-135R 32.7680KA-A3 which is available in the market.
	2. R63 is changed to 10k in all Rev.A board. 
	3. Use another IO to control EN of U16, It helps to reduce the current of R63 by 350uA. In this case, R63 can be back to 1M
	4. add a testpoint of M+, so the MSP430 can be powered up and programmed when M+ is given a back drive voltage.
	5. add bigger testpoints for VDD_ECD
	6. add heat dissipation holes under U16
	7. Q36 might be DMN3033LSNQ-7
	8. add an extra io between ble and msp for interrupt.
	9. add tvs on V_bat, scl and sda
	10. add pull up on SDA and SCL
        11. C7, C8, U16 should be moved to uper space. C7, C8 has no height attribute
