U90 should be compatable with SOT23-6
pull down between v_bat and gnd???


R116 on bottom board changed to 100k
romove R122 on bottom


R20 = 100k on top
L10 is ECS-MPIL0630-2R2MC on top
c17 = 88p on top
R19=7.6k on top
c18 = 17p on top
r22= 791k on top
add 150uF cap on top
replace Q10 Q91, Q92 with lower Rds-on

Improve layout of boost converter to run 500k switching

pull up f up to vdd on front,512k
Remove V_bat to VDD on R4 and Q3 on front
R7 = 1.5k on front???
UPDATE R8 18 10 19

Here is the LED setup for the battery pack that is the winner:
1 Right angle LED, ~1 cm away from the diffuser
color: 523nm Green, 632nm Red
Resistors: 200 Ohm for the green and 68 ohm for the Red
The lens should be diffused
4:27
HSMF-C145 This is the one that I tested, digikey doesn't have any options with diffused lens
4:27
so maybe ignore that, clear lens is fine
4:30
we can try this one: XZMDKDGK56W next time you have a digikey order, lens should be more diffused
