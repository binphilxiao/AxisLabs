Here is the LED setup for the battery pack that is the winner:
1 Right angle LED, ~1 cm away from the diffuser
color: 523nm Green, 632nm Red
Resistors: 200 Ohm for the green and 68 ohm for the Red
The lens should be diffused

so maybe ignore that, clear lens is fine

we can try this one: XZMDKDGK56W next time you have a digikey order, lens should be more diffused
