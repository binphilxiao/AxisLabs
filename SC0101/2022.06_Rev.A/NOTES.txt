Round 1
{
	1. BTN_STOP should be renamed to USR_BTN
	Yes
	2. SIG_ENDET should be revisited when plastic material is chosen
	Add a schmitt opamp to generate a digital signal.
	3. U8 price is too high, please find a cheaper one, ideally around 0.1$US at 5K
	There is no better options for bipolar sensor, but it is a popular package, we can test it and change it later
	4. Battery is 2 cells (not 3 cells like SmartShade) please revisit resistors for LEDs and Vbatt div
	Yes
	5. Power consumption of U6 is not acceptable
	Went back to TI's buck
	6. Let's add accelerometer to the schematic
	No better accelerometer found than MMA7660FCR1, 
	the meter IC is added
	7. Add nRF GPIO to control MSP HW Reset line
	The nRST of MSP is also SBWTDIO which is bi-directional
	I add a switch of MSP power and add a 10k drain resistor for MSP power
	8. J2 connector pinout does not match motor datasheet pinout (Vcc, Fg, CW/CCW, Gnd, PWM) to which we would add Fg_1 and Fg_2 in a row
	Yes
	9. Add reverse protection
 	Yes
	10. Use one IO to control LED
	Yes
	11. Add connector for accessories
	Yes
}
	
	
Round 2
{
	1.For LED I suggest to use QBLP600-RGB-2897 This is from the same manufacturer that makes the SmartShade LED so I think the color and performance will be closer between the products. Also it is cheaper.
	YES, similar Vf for 3 colors.
	2.For the Accessory connector (J3) Pin 1 should be connected to Vbatt not VDD_BLE
	YES
	3.The accelerometer is obsolete part. Just scrap it for now, we will revisit that idea if the omni-polar does not work.
	YES
	4.U13 is out of stock but the SOT-89 package is available with lots of stock. Maybe switch package?
	YES, BOTH SOT25 AND SOT89 ARE LOW IN STOCK. It is hard to say which one is better.
	5.Q19 is to protect against battery installed in reverse. Correct?
	yes
	6.The circuit section for controlling VDD_ECD may not be necessary if omnipolar works but good to keep for now.
	yes, there is a 0ohm bypass res
}

Round 3
{
	1. Perhaps we can add GND pad that will touch the screw so we can use the screw as a GND point when probing for debug
	yes, add pads to 4 mounting holes
	2. Maybe add more stitching vias between GND plane and Top plane
	yes
	3. Update more popular parts for D2, D3, use individual tvs for MFP1-2
	yes, 
	4. change to JST for all 4 connectors
	yes
