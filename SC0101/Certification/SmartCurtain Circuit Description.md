# SmartCurtain Circuit Description

#### The RYSE SmartCurtain seamlessly transforms your existing window curtains into motorized SmartCurtains.

#### BLE-0101 is a BLE5.0 module based on NRF52840 from Nodic Semiconductor. It is dedicated to implement Bluetooth communication between the SmartCurtain and the cellphone.

#### BLE-0101 has a built-in PCB trace antenna. The antenna works in BLE band(2.402G-2.485GHz)

#### BLE-0101 controls buttons and indicator LEDs to interact with users.

#### SmartCurtain is powered by 2 18650 batteries.

#### The reverse protection stop reversed voltage.

#### The low voltage circuitry shutdown power when the batteries is low.

#### The regulator regulates 3.3v to the whole system from the input.

#### The rod end detection tell when the device moves to one end of the rod.

#### The encoder tells how far the device moves and the exact location.

#### SPI flash is not populated.

#### Bare PCB is Rev.C

#### BOM is Rev.C.1
