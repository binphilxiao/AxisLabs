Rev.A
	P8 should be behind the capacitor.
	D4-D9 PCB decal reversed.
	sw_rst is not correctly connected. Reference to Omega2S-Dev-Board.pdf.
	Add necessary markings.
	Package error of P2(micro usb) .mounting holes are too far away.
	Micro usb should stick out of the board edge a bit.
	Ethernet transformer reference should be floating.
	Ethernet shield should be ground.
	Missing marking for R15,C29,C36
	D2 & D3 &D10 package flipped
	U7 should behind the current measurement connector
	R11 should be nop
	Remove gnd and pwr plane below ble antenna.
	Decrease solder mask spacing for D2, D10,D3
	Remove the plane beneath the BLE antanna
	R11 should be nop
	Boot indicator in ONION and BLE
	PRG_NRESET PULL UP TO VDD_BLE

Reset problem on board #5

Here are the notes for the Bridge review:
U9 part is deprecated but they have a replacement part with similar specs, so just need a quick review
For P7, please add Tx, Rx, Gnd marking on the silkscreen of the part decal"
Please break the UART_Tx and UART_Rx lines with 0Ohm resistor and add 2 headers (SIP-3P) on either side of the resistors, this will be used for automated testing
Did you test the USB OC chip in current board? As well as OC / OV testing and checking the quality of the Buck converter circuit (efficiency / ripple) ect?
U5, U6 (and all their passives) R42, R43 should be market NOP
U10, B input needs a resistor pull up

last I will spend some time later thinking about the test points needed for factory jig testing, but you should spend some time on that as well since this is likely the revision for production.
