- Functional description
  The RYSE BLE0101 is an advanced, highly flexible, ultra-low power multiprotocol System on Module (SoM) that enables Bluetooth 5 low energy and IEEE 802.15.4 (Thread and Zigbee) connectivity for portable, and extremely low power embedded systems. With an Arm® Cortex®-M4 with FPU processor, integrated 2.4G Hz transceiver, and an integrated antenna, the BLE0101  provides a complete RF solution allowing faster time to market with reduced development costs. Providing full use of the Nordic Semiconductor nRF52840’s capabilities and peripherals, the BLE0101  can power the most demanding applications, all while simplifying designs and reducing BOM costs. The BLE0101 is an ideal solution for designs that require Bluetooth 5 features or 802.15.4 based networking for Thread and Zigbee. Increased integration with built in USB and 5.5 V compatible DC/DC supply reduces design complexity and BOM cost, while expanding possible applications. BLE0101 designs are footprint compatible with the BMD-300/301/330/360, providing low-cost flexibility for tiered product lineups.
